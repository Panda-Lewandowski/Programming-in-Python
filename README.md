# Programming in Python
This repository has been created to save the labs, written while learning Python in the first year of [BMSTU, Moscow](http://www.bmstu.ru/). It contains all sorts of tasks, from solving the quadratic equation to numerical methods. Many algorithms are planned to improve. Not all projects can be ideal because they were created during training. <br>
